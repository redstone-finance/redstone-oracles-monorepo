# RedStone Oracles Monorepo

Monorepo containing all the main components of the RedStone oracles ecosystem.

## 💡 RedStone ecosystem

RedStone is a data ecosystem that delivers frequently updated, reliable and
diverse data for your dApp and smart contracts.

It uses a radically different way of putting data on-chain. The data is automatically attached to a user's transaction
and erased afterwards thus reducing gas fees without touching the expensive evm storage.

You can learn more at https://docs.redstone.finance
