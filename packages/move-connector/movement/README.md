### Move code conventions
We try to follow conventions from [here](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/book/coding-conventions).


## What should be audited

### Move files

The code-lines inside the following sections in `*/sources/**/*.move` files should be audited,
according to the [Coding conventions](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/book/coding-conventions)
* Definitions
  * `// === Structs ===`
  * `// === Errors ===`
  * `// === Constants ===`
* Interface Functions
  * `// === Public-Friend Functions ===`
  * `// === Entry-Mutative Functions ===`
  * `// === Public-View Functions ===`
* Other/Helper functions
  * `// === Public Functions ===`
  * `// === Public-Mutative Functions ===`
  * `// === Private Functions ===`

And the following **should not**:

* `// === Imports ===`
* `// === Test Functions ===`
* Code comments
* Empty lines
* Code inside test files inside `*/tests/**` directories

### Other files

* We suggest to read `**/README.md`
* We suggest to audit Dependencies inside `**/Move.toml` files


### Demo

Dependencies needed:
* jq - https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/
* rust - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

To run on the testnet follow these steps:
* if you dont have movement cli installed install it
* if you dont have movement initialized init it
  * set network to 'custom' and paste "https://aptos.testnet.bardock.movementlabs.xyz/v1" as a network rpc
* deploy adapter and price-feed
* write sample data & read sample data from the feed
```sh
make install-cli
make init-movement

make deploy-price-adapter
make deploy-price-feed

make write-sample-data

make read-price
make read-price-timestamp
make read-timestamp
```
