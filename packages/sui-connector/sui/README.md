### Move code conventions
We try to follow conventions from [here](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/conventions).

Differences:
* There's added a section called `Public Functions` for functions that are public and non-mutable but are not view-only.
  For example
  * Functions creating structs.
  * Functions filtering collections.

## What should be audited

### Move files

The code-lines inside the following sections in `*/sources/**/*.move` files should be audited,
according to the [Section naming guide](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/conventions#add-section-titles)

* Definitions
  * `// === Structs ===`
  * `// === Errors ===`
  * `// === Constants ===`
* Interface Functions
  * `// === Public-Package Functions ===`
  * `// === Public-Mutative Functions ===`
  * `// === Public-View Functions ===`
* Other/Helper functions
  * `// === Admin Functions ===`
  * `// === Public Functions ===`
  * `// === Private Functions ===`
  * `// === Method Aliases ===`

And the following **should not**:

* `// === Imports ===`
* `// === Test Functions ===`
* Code comments
* Empty lines
* Code inside test files inside `*/tests/**` directories

### Other files

* We suggest to read `**/README.md`
* We suggest to audit Dependencies inside `**/Move.toml` files
