# RedStone Oracles integration with Fuel

## üí° How RedStone Oracles work with Fuel

*RedStone Oracles* use an alternative design of providing oracle data to smart contracts. Instead of constantly
persisting
data on the contract's storage (by data providers), the information is brought on-chain only when needed (by end users).
Until that moment data remains in the decentralized cache layer, which is powered by RedStone light cache gateways and
streamr data broadcasting protocol. Data is transferred to the contract by end users, who should attach signed data
packages to their function invocations. The information integrity is verified on-chain through signature checking.

To learn more about RedStone oracles design go to the [RedStone docs](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/introduction)

## üìÑ Smart Contracts

### RedStoneCore

- Sample oracle contract that consumes *RedStone Oracles* data [redstone_core.sw](src/redstone_core.sw) written in sway version
  0.61.2.

#### ‚®ê initializer

```rust
fn init(signers: Vec<b256>, signer_count_threshold: u64)
```

As mentioned above, the data packages transferred to the contract are being verified by signature checking.
To be counted to achieve the `signer_count_threshold`, the signer signing the passed data
should be one of the `signers` passed in the initializer.
There is also needed `signer_count_threshold` to be passed.

That initializer can be invoked only by the owner or by anyone when no owner was previously set.
Contract can be re-initialized by subsequent invocations of the initializer.

That's a `#[storage(write)]` function - it consumes GAS and modifies the contract's storage, so must be paid by ETHs.

In the function parameters below, each `feed_id` is a string encoded to `u256` which means, that's a value
consisting of hex-values of the particular letters in the string. For example:
`ETH` as a `u256` is `0x455448` in hex or `4543560` in decimal,
as `256*256*ord('E')+256*ord('T')+ord('H')`.
<br />
üìü You can use: `feed_id = hexlify(toUtf8Bytes(feed_string)))` to convert particular values or
the https://cairo-utils-web.vercel.app/ endpoint<br />

The value `payload` is passed as an array of bytes representing the packed RedStone payload. Each byte of the
payload is a single `u64`.
<br />
üìö See RedStone data-packing: https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/how-it-works
and the [Sample payload](#-sample-payload) section below.

#### ‚®ó get_prices

```rust
fn get_prices(feed_ids: Vec<u256>, payload: Vec<u64>) -> Vec<u256>
```

The function processes on-chain the `payload` passed as an argument
and returns an array of aggregated values of each feed passed as an identifier inside `feed_ids`.

That's just a `#[storage(read)]` function - it consumes GAS but doesn't modify the contract's storage.

## üìñ Sample payload

See [here](../README.md#preparing-sample-data), how to generate it.

Then the hex response is needed to be split to single bytes, for example, by using `Array.from(arrayify(payloadHex))`
functions of `ethers` node package.

üìñ See: [README.md](../README.md) to see the environment possibilities and sample scripts invoking the functions.

## ‚ö† Possible transaction failures

* The number of signers recovered from the signatures matched with `addresses` passed in the initializer
  must be greater or equal that the `signer_count_threshold` in the constructor, for each feed.
    * Otherwise, it panics then with the `0x2710_0000 = 655360000` error, increased by the first index of the passed
      feed which has broken the validation.
    * The number of signers for that data feed is presented in logs.
* The timestamp of data-packages must be not older than 15 minutes in relation to the `block_timestamp`.
    * Otherwise, it panics then with the `0x9C40_0000 = 2621440000` error, increased by the first index of the payload's
      data package which has broken the validation, increased additionally by `1000` if the package is older than
      expected
      and `2000` if its timestamp is too future.
    * The timestamp of that data package and `block_timestamp` are presented in logs.
* The `init` & `write_prices` functions consume gas and must be paid by ETHers. The data are available on the contract
  just after the transaction successes.
