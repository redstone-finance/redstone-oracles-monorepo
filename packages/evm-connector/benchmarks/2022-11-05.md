# Benchmarks summary and conslusions (2022-11-05)

This benchmarking was focused on checking the viability of the idea of shifting free memory pointer back after each data package extraction.

It turned out that it's worth it (esp. for bigger data packages and for the case with more memory allocated before)

## Gas differences (no additional memory allocated)

```js
1 signers, 1 symbols, 1 points: -20
1 signers, 20 symbols, 20 points: 44
3 signers, 1 symbols, 1 points: -10
3 signers, 2 symbols, 1 points: 4
3 signers, 20 symbols, 20 points: 374
```

## Gas difference (additional 50KB of memory allocated before calling the `getOracleNumericValueFromTxMsg` function)

```js
1 signers, 1 symbols, 1 points: -20
1 signers, 20 symbols, 20 points: 147
3 signers, 1 symbols, 1 points: 45
3 signers, 2 symbols, 1 points: 139
3 signers, 20 symbols, 20 points: 997
```
